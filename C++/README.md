#C++

1. To check if a float has decimal part or not, use ```(value-floor(value))```. If this is equal to 0, then the float has no decimal part and it is an integer, else it is a float.
2. Use sqrt inbuilt to find sqrt and then use the above logic to figure if a given number is a perfect square or not.
