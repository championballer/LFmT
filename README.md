# java

Repository includes all code written while picking up JAVA syntax.We start without any IDE, and rather take an independent approach about learning java, that is by employing the terminal to compile and run java files atleast in the beginning.

1. To work with i/o, we import java.io.Console. Then,
  
  ```java
  Console console = System.console();
  console.printf("%s",variable);
  String variable = console.readLine();
  
  ```
